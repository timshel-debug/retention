# Addendum Request: Observability and Coordinated Deletion

## Request
- Clarify the origin and scope of ADR-0006 (Coordinated Deletion).
- Provide addendum design documents and diagrams for:
  - Observability (lean into OpenTelemetry and instrumentation).
  - Coordinated deletion (future enhancement / out of scope for coding exercise).

## Constraints
- The authoritative functional requirements are in:
  - `Octopus_Deploy_Code_Puzzle-Release_Retention.zip` (Start Here - Instructions - Release Retention.md)
- The DSDS must not introduce new *in-scope* requirements that deviate from the coding exercise.
- Addenda may specify optional future enhancements, clearly labelled as out of scope.
