# Downloadable Bundle — Retention Refactor Requirements

Open `docs/00_Overview.md` first.

## Contents
- `docs/*.md` — Requirements specs per pattern + overview + implementation prompt stub
- `diagrams/` — Reserved for future Mermaid diagrams (optional)

## Intended usage
- Provide this bundle to an implementation agent (Copilot/Cursor/Claude).
- Implement in small commits, keeping behavior stable and using golden tests.
